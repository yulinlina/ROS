## Introdution
ROS (Robot Operating System) is rapidly becoming a de facto standard in robot programming. Using the turtlesim simulator, this course will provide a hands-on introduction to programming robots with ROS with an emphasis on middleware concepts and ROS architecture. The topics to be covered includeï¼šbasic ROS concepts, controlling a robot with ROS, communication and coordination between multiple robots, ROS programming with Python. The assessment is based on a Python implementation of leader-follower formation control of multi robots.
