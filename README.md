## Introdution
ROS (Robot Operating System) is rapidly becoming a de facto standard in robot programming. Using the turtlesim simulator, this course will provide a hands-on introduction to programming robots with ROS with an emphasis on middleware concepts and ROS architecture.   
***The topics to be covered include:***
1. basic ROS concepts  
2. controlling a robot with ROS  
3. communication and coordination between multiple robots  
4. ROS programming with Python. 
5. The assessment is based on a Python implementation of leader-follower formation control of multi robots
6. simulating robot models in ROS
7. making an autonomous robot in ROS  
8. path planning
9. obstacle detection and mapping  
10. ROS programming with Python.
